## üñ•Ô∏è Client Installation

### Prerequisites

- A Linux-based operating system (Ubuntu, Debian, Fedora, WSL, etc.).
- Python 3.x installed.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Start by cloning the Neo AI repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Vasco0x4/Neo-AI.git
cd Neo-AI
```

### Step 2: Run the Installation Script

Execute the installation script to set up the environment:

```bash
sudo ./install.sh
```

This script will:

- Create a Python virtual environment.
- Install the necessary Python packages.
- Set up the Neo AI configuration files.
- Add an alias to your `.bashrc` for easy access.

### Step 3: Reload Your Terminal

To apply the changes made by the installation script, restart your terminal or run:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

If Neo AI doesn't work immediately after installation, it may be necessary to add the alias manually. Run the following command inside the Neo AI directory (where `main.py` is located):

```bash
echo "alias neo='source $(pwd)/venv/bin/activate && python3 $(pwd)/main.py'" >> ~/.bashrc
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Server Installation

### Prerequisites

Before proceeding with the server installation, ensure that your system meets the following hardware and software requirements:

Linux or Windows
- **Memory**: 16GB+ of RAM is recommended.
- **VRAM**: 6GB+ of VRAM is recommended.  

MacOS

- **M1/M2/M3** with macOS 13.6 or newer.
  

For more information, please refer to the [LM Studio minimum hardware](https://lmstudio.ai/#what-are-the-minimum-hardware-/-software-requirements?).
  
### Step 1: Install LM Studio

1. **Download & Install LM Studio**:

   For Linux, macOS, or Windows, go to the [LM Studio website](https://lmstudio.ai/) and download the latest version compatible with your operating system.

2. **Configure LM Studio**:

   - First, install the desired model in LM Studio (e.g., LLaMA 3.1B is recommended). pre-prompt is designed for LLaMA 3 models.
   - You need to configure the listening Port if not set by default.

3. **Set the Pre-Prompt**:

   Copy and paste the Neo Pre-Prompt, which can be found in the [PrePromt.md](../config/PrePromt.md) file.

4. **Set the Context Length**:

   It is recommended to set the context length between 4000 and 8000 tokens for best results.

### Step 2: Test LM Studio Server

Once LM Studio is installed and running, you can test if the server is working properly using the `curl` command. Replace `192.168.0.151` with your actual server IP address.

```bash
curl -X GET http://192.168.0.151:6959/v1/models -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

If the server is working correctly, you should receive a response.


### Step 3: Configure the `config.yaml` for Neo AI Client

You need to configure the `config.yaml` file on the client side to ensure Neo AI can communicate with the LM Studio server. 

## üß™ Testing Neo AI

To start Neo AI on the client machine, simply type:

```bash
neo
```

This will launch Neo AI if everything is configured correctly.

### Common Issues

- **Connection Issues**: Verify that the client can reach the server IP and port. Check firewall settings or network configurations if necessary.
- **Dependencies Not Installed**: If dependencies weren‚Äôt installed correctly, try deleting the `.venv` folder and rerun the installation script.
- **Voice Commands Not Working**: Run `/docs/testes/test_vocal_device.py` to find the correct microphone index if you're using voice commands.
