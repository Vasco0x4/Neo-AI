### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/vasco0x4/neo-ai.git
cd neo-ai
```

2. Run the installation script:
```bash
./install.sh
echo "alias neo='source $(pwd)/venv/bin/activate && python3 $(pwd)/main.py'" >> ~/.bashrc
```

3. Configure Neo:
```bash
cp config/config.yaml.example config/config.yaml
# Edit the configuration file with your preferred settings
nano config/config.yaml
```

4. Start Neo:
```bash
source ~/.bashrc
neo
```
> Note maybe you need to restart you terminal


## üîß Configuration

Neo can be configured using the `config/config.yaml` file to connect with your preferred AI provider:

```yaml
# Operation Mode
mode: "digital_ocean"  # Options: 'lm_studio' or 'digital_ocean'

# LM Studio Configuration (Local)
api:
  key: "lm-studio"
  url: "http://localhost:6959/v1"
  model: "your-model-name"

# DigitalOcean Configuration (Cloud)
digital_ocean:
  agent_id: "your-agent-id"
  agent_key: "your-agent-key"
  agent_endpoint: "https://your-endpoint.app/api/v1"
  model: "model-name"  # Can be a DigitalOcean, OpenAI, or Anthropic model

# Security Settings
security:
  auto_approve_commands: false
  require_approval: true
```

## üíª Using Neo

### Machine Communication Protocol (MCP)

Neo communicates with your system using a protocol system. Here are the key protocols available:

| Protocol | Description | Example Usage |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| `terminal` | Execute shell commands | `ls -la`, `ps aux`, etc. |
| `files` | Manage file operations | Read, write, or list files |
| `analyze` | Comprehensive system analysis | CPU, memory, disk usage |
| `network` | Network operations | Interface info, connections, scanning |
| `security` | Security assessments | User info, open ports, vulnerabilities |

### Example Interactions

```
You: List all running processes

Neo: I'll use the `ps` command to list all running processes.
<mcp:terminal>ps aux</mcp:terminal>

neo > ps aux
  ‚Ü≥ Execute this command? [Enter/n]: _

Here are the top processes by CPU usage:
1. firefox (23.4%)
2. chromium (15.2%)
3. ...
```

```
You: Can you scan my local network?

Neo: I'll scan your local network. This may take a moment:
<mcp:network>scan:192.168.1.0/24</mcp:network>

neo > nmap -F 192.168.1.0/24
  ‚Ü≥ Execute this command? [Enter/n]: _

## üîê Security

Neo is designed with security in mind:

- **Command Approval**: All commands require **explicit approval**
- **Minimal Privileges**: Neo operates with your user permissions by default
- **Secure Configuration**: API keys are stored locally in your configuration

### Custom Context

Neo automatically gathers system information at startup, but you can add additional context:

```bash
# Add persistent memory entry
echo "Custom Info: Value" >> /tmp/persistent_memory.txt
```

### Executing Interactive Commands

Neo can handle interactive commands like vim, nano, or top. When using these, a dedicated interactive session will be created.
